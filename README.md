Capstone ePortfolio

How long have you been in the Computer Science program?
I have been in this program for about 2 years. I wanted to do a career change for my life. I currently work in IT and want to further my knowledge into a full career. I was able to pursue my associate's degree from a community college before coming to SNHU.

What have you learned while in the program? List three of the most important concepts or skills you have learned.
While in the program, I have learned several important concepts and skills, including:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding the principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, has been crucial for developing modular and maintainable code.
Data Structures and Algorithms: Learning about various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming) has been essential for solving complex problems efficiently.
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Gaining knowledge about the different phases of the SDLC, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance, has helped me understand how to manage and execute software projects effectively.
Discuss the specific skills you aim to demonstrate through your enhancements to reach each of the course outcomes.
To reach each of the course outcomes, I aim to demonstrate the following specific skills through my enhancements:

Software Design and Implementation:

Enhancing the existing codebase with additional features while maintaining code quality and readability.
Implementing comprehensive input validation and error handling to ensure the application behaves correctly under invalid input conditions.
Adding support for additional animal types such as birds and reptiles by creating new classes and updating the Driver class to include menu options and methods for their intake, reservation, and printing.
Data Structure Optimization and Efficient Algorithm Implementation:

Using more efficient data structures, such as HashMaps, to store animal data, allowing for faster lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.
Implementing efficient search algorithms to enhance the performance of searching and sorting the animal lists, using techniques like binary search for sorted data and sorting algorithms such as merge sort or quicksort.
Database Integration and Web Development:

Integrating a NoSQL database (MongoDB) with the Java application, performing CRUD operations using the MongoDB Java driver.
Setting up a Spring Boot application and creating RESTful APIs to interact with the MongoDB database.
Developing a web-based interface using HTML/CSS and JavaScript (or a framework like React) to interact with the backend APIs.
How do the specific skills you will demonstrate align with your career plans related to your degree?
The specific skills I will demonstrate through these enhancements align closely with my career plans related to my degree in several ways:

Advancing in Software Development:

The skills in software design and implementation, error handling, validation, and extending functionalities are fundamental to becoming a proficient software developer. These skills will help me create robust and maintainable software solutions, which is crucial for advancing in the field of software development.
Specializing in Data Structures and Algorithms:

Optimizing data structures and implementing efficient algorithms are essential skills for any software engineer. By demonstrating these skills, I will be better equipped to handle complex problems and improve the performance of software applications, aligning with my goal to specialize in this area.
Full-Stack Development:

Integrating databases and developing web-based interfaces are key components of full-stack development. By enhancing the Rescue Animal System to include these features, I will gain practical experience in full-stack development, making me more versatile and capable of handling both front-end and back-end development tasks in my career.
How does this contribute to the specialization you are targeting for your career?
These enhancements contribute to the specialization I am targeting for my career by providing practical experience in areas critical to my desired field:

Software Engineering:

The enhancements in error handling, validation, and extending functionalities demonstrate my ability to design and implement high-quality software solutions, which is essential for a career in software engineering.
Data Management and Analysis:

By optimizing data storage and implementing efficient algorithms, I am building skills that are crucial for roles focused on data management and analysis. These skills will enable me to design systems that handle large datasets efficiently and perform complex analyses.
Full-Stack Development:

The integration of MongoDB and the creation of a web-based interface using Spring Boot align with my goal of becoming a full-stack developer. These skills are in high demand and will allow me to develop comprehensive solutions that span both front-end and back-end technologies.
